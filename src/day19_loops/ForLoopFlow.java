        1) Initialization is executed:

           -> initialization occurs in the beginning of the loop

         2) Termination condition / boolean value is checked
            -> if the boolean is true: code inside the loop is executed
            -> if the boolean is false: the loop stops

         3) Code inside the loop are executed top to bottom
            System.out.println(i);

         4) Update
            the iteration of the variable executes
            i++;

            => one iteration compiled

            goes back to step 2 and repeats
